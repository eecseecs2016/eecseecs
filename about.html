From the creators of EECSEECS.com:
<br> <br>
We originally created this website to parody a specific micro-culture within the EECS undergraduate department community of our university. Too often have we have overheard conversations in various EE/CS buildings that for hours on end are about and solely about the perks and high salaries of jobs, bragging about their internship offers, the prestige of being an EECS major, endless and endless circlejerking.
<br> <br>
We are sick and tired of this. There is so much more to studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science: so many great untapped theoretical and applied ideas to explore (as opposed to this widespread circle-jerking), how to be more inclusive towards diversity (to this day, EECS is predominantly male and white/Asian American), how to keep a check on each other from cheating in classes (there have been countless cases in recent semesters). So, for those who identify with the aforementioned EECS undergraduate micro-culture: please learn to get a life, think for yourself, be considerate of others, and enjoy what you do.
<br> <br>
It is much to our dismay that (1) (lamentably) the ironic language we included in the original website was claimed by the aforementioned micro-culture to further its circle-jerking, and that (2) the University  fought to take the website down by using the excuse that by including its name we were infringing upon certain copyrights. We hope that this memo elucidates our original intent of making this satirical website.
<br> <br>
Sincerely,<br>
